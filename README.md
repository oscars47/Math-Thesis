# Math-Thesis
Repo for all the code used in my math thesis at Pomona College ('24) with Prof. Ami Radunskaya.

## Major updates

## 2/9/24
* trying to figure out the issue with TFD. I believe issue was how I was checking unitarity before. using Operator(circ).is_unitary() (added the new function, is_unitary(circ)). confirmed that TFD with imaginary time evolution is unitary.
* need to fix swap function
** was thinking to only swap the second qubit in bell pair to the first in tfd
** BUT, watched video on the teleportation, and they define the SWAP operation in terms of dirac fermions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZenQViOgxDM
** note from Jafferis and Gao: "Note that this is the ordinary SWAP operator"
** correctly using Aer engine to simulate the measurement of the quantum state resulting from the circuit
** issue is that while rho_L and rho_R are PSD, rho_LR is not PSD
** confirmed the density matrices are valid and calculated mutual info using qiskit.quantum_info.entropy(). got a sensible value, so now testing full protocol.


## 2/7/24
* testing implement_protocol() with variety of changes:
** running 10, 200 revealed a kind of noisy cloud, so:
** added option to fix t0 param to 2.8 like in wormhole paper
** updated time_evolve to take time_step argument in place of steps so the time step is fixed, so at later time values we are still precise
** i think i was using the wrong register for the Ipt: should only be 0 and 2*N-1? no, what
** selective swapping of only the bell term part
* realized rhoL, rhoR, rhoLR not PSD. circuit not unitary. tried removing the swap circuits and still not unitary. in particular TFD is *not* unitary. both the expH and ent are not unitary. 
** issue was i was using DensityMatrix() on the circuit, but need to use Operator().data. need to revisit and fix.
** no duh, the expH won't be unitary bc no factor of 1j. 
 

## 2/5-6/24
* finished rest of wormhole protocol using strictly QC representation (up until computing I)
** added get_TFD(), get_bell_pair(), get_expV(), and implement_protocol() which puts it all together
* added zlokapa_code.py which has snippets from Zlokapa's thesis (ended up not using)

## 2/4/24
* reorganizing syk_qk.py so that get_SYK returns the H pauli_sum_op object.
* added get_TFD(), which depends on get_bell_pair(), time_reverse(), time_reverse_op().
* realized need to add both the L and R definitions for the jordan-wigner because in the potential term otherwise they all become I (added param, ```left```).
* changing from Zlokapa's definition so all values are in terms of Qiskit QC representation.
** for expV, we use 20 trotter steps and imaginary time (so the exponent is real)
** left the matrix versions of these in comments for future refer.
* fixed trotter_suzuki_circuit to accept imaginary time steps


## 1/30/24
* built syk_qk.py, which has the function get_SYK() to generate SYK hamiltonian for any given number of majorana fermions. automatically runs trotterization. was able to convert time evolution circuit with 20 trotter steps from 0 to 1 from about 580000 gates to 10, for an avg speedup of 58036 += 0 and avg fidelity to original of 6.087174651948914e-12 Â± 1.2044172115152807e-12, for 10 hamiltonians. (built function to benchmark_SYK to automatically run these computations).

## 1/18/24
* realized making a CCNOT gate is impossible w EA2.1 bc it only allows CNOT between neighbors. making a convolutional transformer to decompose circuit structure for N<=10 qubits.

* sphynx_gen.py creates the random matrices and decoded structure to be used in training; sphynx.py will have the actual code for the transformer.

## 1/17/24
* Was able to run SWAP, CSWAP. not able to solve CCNOT or CCCNOT. why? let's debug this.

* hide print statements

* log performance over time, as well as final loss as a function of number of gates used to construct the same circuit, ran several times --> gets at somewhat of the solution space

* try out hilbert schmidt norm?

* get plan for measurement

To do:
* correct CCNOT

* Read more doc of Qiskit transpile

* Implement computation of measurements for chaos so we can directly compare w theory. Need to figure out pricing. --> measure correlations between all qubits? what would be an effective measurement that shows we've learned the circuits?

* get benchmark for EA2.1 and qiskit on **(3,5), (3,15), (6,5), (6,15)**, (8, 5), (8, 15), (10, 5), (10, 15). log avg time to complete, avg acc, sem acc. 

* do qiskit simulation, real thing!!

* Once we have figured out the above, go back to SYK model in cirq -- + test w model 2.1!!


## 1/16/23
* added 3 levels of ```debug``` to find_params
* tested on model 2.1: Hadamard, X, Y, Z, CZ, SWAP, CCNOT (Toffoli), CSWAP (Fredkin), CCCNOT (Toffoli w 2 control). 
** problem with final RP prune not preserving the actual RP sequence: incorrectly pasing the sample circuit using the test_seq to the run. fixed this.

 * also separate issue with CZ: realized that the current framework of EA2.1 does not allow simultaneous operations. fixed this by changing the framework to account for operations to be applied in simultaneous moments. 

## 1/15/24
Realized Qiskit has a module, transpile, which can convert an arbitrary unitary into decomposed circuit. BUT: much less efficient in terms of number of gates used compared to my algorithm: using a random_circuit(3,5) EA2.1 used ~6 gates whereas Qiskit transpile used ~60-100. Need rigorous comparison


### 1/13/24
Troubleshooting model 0; it doesn't seem possible to simplify as you go, so will create model 2.1 which essentially does model 2 but then finds all the stretches of RxRyRzP and simplifies after the fact. Implemented this. Increased num times to run trabbit from 1 to 5.

Benchmarking model 2 first: tested on depth of 5 up to 6 qubits, up to depth of 15 on 3 qubits. Handles great on my laptop and will run rigrous test with model 2.1 simplification when I get back from Germany. 

Realized major impracticality: adds more RP blocks even if no CNOTs: only add if 1) there are no gates yet or 2) there is a CNOT currently as the last item in the qubit list. Fixed this, and this increases speed by quite a bit.

Reminder: all in elegans_adapt2.py

### 1/9/24
Fixed issue with sample circuits 4-9. Model 2 can now effectively handle [some rotation] CNOT [some rotation] and CNOT [rotation] in any order on the qubits. Will implement simplification on each individual RP section tomorrow.
 

### 1/6/24
Wrote new Circuit class in circuit.py to handle storage, updating of genes and conversion to unitary. Implemented in elegans_adapt2.py for the iterative learning circuit. Started test_circuits.py which is a framework for simulating the circuits and actually experimentally testing them using Qiskit.

### 1/3/24
Developed "learning circuit" in elegans_new.py using the Pauli spin, P, CNOT. Also built a genetic algorithm in ga.py. Adapting elegans_new.py to cirq in elegans_cirq.py to better study the circuits with CNOTs--since if we do not allow any CNOTs, a circuit of only 4N for N qubits can learn a circuit of arbitrary depth.


### 11/6/23
As of the LO, the code I am using is ```syk.py``` to generate the Majorana operators and SYK Hamiltonians. ```interact_jg.py``` adapts Jafferis and Gao et al to implement the wormhole teleportation protocol.
