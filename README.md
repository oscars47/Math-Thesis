# Math-Thesis
Repo for all the code used in my math thesis at Pomona College ('24) with Prof. Ami Radunskaya.

LO: 11/6/23

As of the LO, the code I am using is ```syk.py``` to generate the Majorana operators and SYK Hamiltonians. ```interact_jg.py``` adapts Jafferis and Gao et al to implement the wormhole teleportation protocol.
